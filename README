The goal of the project is to develop a methodology that allows text mining for items of the risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews. 
In order to do this, a set of published systematic reviews (listed in Included-fulltexts-PDF) were manually scanned and scored for such items (data in Translation-extraction.xlsx). This served as a 'training set'. The developped methodology was then applied to a bigger set of published systematic reviews. In order to handle the different formatting in the papers, all the Pdfs were converted to html format (2_pdfs_to_htmlFUN.R). Subsequently, each paper was divided in the different sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references) (with the function defined in 1_lib_regex_sectionsFUN.R) and, using regular expressions (defined in 1_lib_regex_sectionsFUN.R), the mining was performed (3_Mining.R). 

Measures of accuracy such as precision, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity were used iteratively to improve the regular expressions and functions on the training set (4_Accuracy_trainingset.R)
